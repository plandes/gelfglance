# Forward glance statistics as gelf logs

This command line utility forwards [Glances] statistics and forwards the data
to [Graylog].  The program runs in a loop for an (optional) given number of
times in a timeout.  Each loop cycle collects data from the [Glances] server
and forwards the data as a "first class" (descrete fields) Graylog message.

With this data you can configured dashboards to report statistics based on
system health, temperatures etc.

The program currently records the following:

* CPU temperature (sensors)
* CPU load

Other data from [Glances] is very easy to add, I just haven't had a lot of time
to add them but I'd be glad to if someone asked for more.  If so, create an
issue and I'll look into your request.
